### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github profile!
=============================

About Me
--------

My name is Puspak Meher, and I am currently pursuing my Integrated M.Sc in Applied Physics. I am interested in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Data Science. I have completed several internships and projects related to these fields and have worked with companies such as Feynn Labs, Omdena, and Solulab.

Projects
--------

Here are some of the personal projects that I have worked on:

-   Lungs infection Detection caused by COVID 19 Virus: Used Unet and Segnet models with different hyperparameters to detect lungs infection caused by COVID-19 virus. Compared the accuracy between these models. The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/phycoding/COVID19_Infection).

-   Diabetes Classification using PIMA indian dataset: Built an end-to-end project that classified whether a person had diabetes or not using the PIMA Indian dataset. Also added the features of exercise recommendation and personal training according to diabetic level. The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/phycoding/herakudiabetes).

-   AI Music Player: Built a next-word and character predictor for a music player using machine learning algorithms. Deployed the project with Streamlit application. The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/phycoding/AImusicplayer).

-   OCR: Built an OCR application that recognizes and extracts text from an image. The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/phycoding/ocr).

-   Ground water prediction and limiting usage using Neural Networks with IOT Integration: Used Neural Networks with IOT Integration to predict ground water levels and limit usage to avoid over-exploitation. The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/phycoding/Water-Level-Prediction).

Skills
------

Here are some of my technical skills:

-   Programming languages: Python, C, C++
-   Machine learning: Scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow
-   Computer vision: OpenCV, Image processing
-   Data analysis: Pandas, Numpy
-   Data visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
-   Databases: MongoDB, SQL
