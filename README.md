### Hi there! 👋
Welcome to my Github profile! 🌟

About Me
--------
I am Puspak Meher. 🚀 Passionate about Machine Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, Algorithm building, and Data Science. 💻

Projects
--------
Here are some of the personal projects that I have worked on:

-   **Lungs Infection Detection caused by COVID-19 Virus:** Used Unet and Segnet models with different hyperparameters to detect lungs infection caused by COVID-19 virus. 🦠 Compared the accuracy between these models. [Check it out here](https://github.com/phycoding/COVID19_Infection).

-   **Diabetes Classification using PIMA Indian Dataset:** Built an end-to-end project that classifies whether a person has diabetes using the PIMA Indian dataset. 🩺 Added features of exercise recommendation and personal training according to diabetic levels. [Explore the code](https://github.com/phycoding/heraku-diabetes).

-   **AI Music Player:** Developed a next-word and character predictor for a music player using machine learning algorithms. 🎶 Deployed the project with Streamlit application. [Code available here](https://github.com/phycoding/AImusicplayer).

-   **OCR:** Created an OCR application that recognizes and extracts text from an image. 📷 [Check out the code](https://github.com/phycoding/ocr).

-   **Groundwater Prediction and Limiting Usage with Neural Networks and IOT Integration:** Used Neural Networks with IOT Integration to predict groundwater levels and limit usage to avoid over-exploitation. 🌊
